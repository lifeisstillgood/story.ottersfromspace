Paddleboarding 
==============

Oliver dipped the edge of the oat into the cloudy water ahead of him and gently pulled it back.  The river was serenely rolling around him. He pulled his paddleboard forward slightly and then just let the momentum carry him over the water. Ollie sat back lazily on his haunches, then rolled onto his back, his knees in the air.




Olivier gets shot
=================

Mr Cavalleo sneered an ugly sneer like his soul has forgotten what
other people might feel.

The sneer stayed on his face as he pointed the large pistol at the small
child's head from just a few feet away, and pulled the trigger.

The child, named Oliver, had two thoughts go through his head.
The first is "He really is going to shoot me". Not like the "Get up there and
tidy your room or I will kill you" kind of threats he was used to.  But actual
kill you. In fact he had not even been threatened.  Cavalleo just walked into
his room, saw him and, and ... fired.

The second thought was "Oh god. I'm going to die".

Emotions don't always use the brain - they have to have extra help from
hormones in the body, telling the rest of the body what the brain has
worked out. So Oliver had not actually started to be upset as the
bullet left the gun, his hormones were still running hard to let the rest of his body know they should start crying

It seemed time slowed down.

Oliver's eyes saw the bullet leave the gun, heading straight for his
right eye.  The flame from the cartridge burst around the dark shadow
of the bullet, like pictures of a solar eclipse from a book, the Moon
getting larger and closer at deadly speed.  His hormones were really
running now, they knew that they had to let his stomach know to churn
up and get all upset.  And they knew that bullet was going to move
*fast*.


And then it wasn't.  The Bullet had stopped - about six inches in
front of Oliver's right eye.  It stopped not because there was
anything wrong with the bullet - it stopped because it was now held by
a small clawed paw.  The ripples from the impact of the bullet hitting
the paw were starting to travel down the small creatures arm, fluffing out the
wet fur in circles down the arm towards the body.


The bullet itself had become odd and misshapen - the back part of the
bullet was still round and flat but it had been pushing the front half
- the front half had *tried* to keep on going but had found the paw was
not going to go anywhere - and so the front part of the bullet had
molded itself to the paw, trying to edge round between each individual
claw like steel silly putty.


The small furry animal was looking sideways back at Oliver.  It
reminded Oliver of the time his friend at school Benny, had caught a
tennis ball thrown really hard in a game of "duck or hurt" - instead
of the usual laugh and smile Benny had just turned and looked back at
Oliver and gave him this "That was awesome, but I'm just going smile a
tiny part of my mouth and be cool, because that is awesome-r"


Yeah that's how the Otter was looking at him.  "Just how awesome am I"


Then the otters eyes slid back to Mr Cavalleo.  Mr Cavalleo's own eyes
were trying to catch up with events.  After trying to simply kill a
small child with a shot to the head, Mr Cavalleo's eyes (and the rest
of him) was trying to get a better look at what seemed impossible -
the bullet had stopped, no, it had been *caught*.  By something that
looked like an ... Mr Cavalleo stuck his neck forward to get a better
look.  Turns out that was a bad idea.


Otters, it seems, don't like cold-hearted, vicious would-be child
killers.  

In fact, Otters really really don't like cold-hearted,
vicious would-be child killers.  

So the Otter head-butted him.  Hard.


Now an otter weighs only three or four pounds, even wet.  And Mr
Cavalleo weighs at least 20 Stone.  In normal circumstances (if you
can ever call getting an otter nutting you between the eyeballs
*normal*) in normal circumstances the otter would have pretty much no
effect.


It certainly would not throw Mr Cavalleo backwards fully six feet to
land spread-eagled against the wall, brick dust spreading down.

But this is what happened.

The otter landed lightly back down on Oliver's lap, and jumped down to
the floor, tossing the lump of metal that mere seconds ago was the
bullet going to end Oliver's life over his furry shoulder.


"Come on," said the otter to Oliver, "let's get you out of here. then we
can find your parents."


Oliver blinked once, quite slowly and then scrambled after the otter
now walking out the door and down the hall, while behind the the limp
body of Mr Cavalleo peeled itself off the wall and thumped down to the
floor.



Blurb
=====

Oliver thinks he is having a bad day.  His parents have been
kidnapped, a billion dollar secret formula has been stolen, and a
cold-blooded, evil killer has a gun pointed at his head.

All Oliver has on his side is an Otter he met in the river behind his
house.

An Otter from Space.

Oliver's day is about to get a lot better.  And a whole lot more
exciting.

And anyone not on the Otter's side is about to have a really, *really*
bad day.
