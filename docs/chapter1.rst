Paddleboarding 
==============

Oliver dipped the edge of the oar into the cloudy water ahead of him and gently pulled it back.  The river was rolling around him. He pulled his paddleboard forward slightly and then just let the momentum carry him over the water. Ollie sat back lazily on his haunches, then rolled onto his back, his knees in the air.  Oliver drifted gently along the river, water softly steaming along the board a few inches from his ear.  

The trees slid past the sky as he looked up, the sole cloud in the sky seemed to stay still as the trees calmly ghosted past.  He closed his eyes to just listen, the trees rustling their leaves in the wind, and looked over at the bushes on the bend.  Last week the Kingfisher nearing there had flown out looking for food and he hoped to see him again.

A splash caught his eye, and Oliver smiled in anticipation.  A small head bobbed above the surface off his bow, down by his right foot and a small furry arm lazily stretched out towards the board.  Oliver held his breath.  He has seen the family of otters before, and this youngster was playful and fearless, coming out a near humans was a rarity, but this family seemed unfazed by humans.

Ollie slowly leaned the oar out towards the otter as the board overtook the small creature - maybe this time ... yes ! The otter clung onto the flat blade and swung itself onto the aluminium pole, trying to climb the pole like a tree branch.  Oliver knew what he was after - but After a moments scrabbling the youngster fell back into the water with a splash.  Ollie pulled a piece of dried salmon from his pouch and balanced it onto the oar, reaching out behind his board.  The otter swatted at the blade and grabbed for the treat as it hit the water, surfacing on his back, treasure held in two paws as he began to chew.  Yes, thought Oliver you are only interested in paddleboards for one thing.  Ollie glanced over at the river bank and counted the family as much as he could.  He would enter the sighting into the online log later today.  But was that another larger otter on the bank? Is that maybe some territorial thing going on? Ollie worries for his salmon loving friend 
And he headed home.

Oliver steered towards the landing stage - a few wooden planks held fast against the river bank at the end of his parents garden.

Oliver planted his paddle in the water just behind his left foot and it acted as a brake swinging the front of the board round in a circle just swinging under the landing stage, and came to a rest perfectly parallel to the wooden boards.  He leaned over, grabbed on with his hand and then sat down on the stage.  He could see through the open back wall into his mum's kitchen.  She was just turning round as three men in suits walked round the back and into the kitchen.

Oliver pulled the board onto the grass as he wondered who the men were - probably more guys like dad.  Making the world better - doing important government stuff.  Oliver liked that his dad was sometimes on the news, but would like to, you know, see him more often.

One of the guys spoke to his mum, and Ollie could tell something was wrong.  Oliver knew his mum, her body language and her tones, so he knew she was both scared and angry, just from the way she looked down the garden at him. He could also tell something was wrong the way she then glanced at the man in the suit and hit him hard round the head with a frying pan.  He collapsed hard as the other two men lunged towards his mum.

Oliver started running toward the kitchen shouting "mum!!", but stopped as she, flinging the pan flat towards the man on her right, screamed at him 

"No Ollie - run! get in the summer house!." 

Ollie stopped, unsure. His mum grabbed the man on her left by the arm and twisted him down, but a jet of white gas sprang from his other hand, hitting her in the face. 

"Go!" she screamed and Oliver turned and ran to the door of the small one room garden house.  

He could feel another man running towards him, as he leapt through the door, and turned to push it shut with both hands.  Oliver glanced up at the house to see his mum, looking groggy, swaying slightly as she pulled at the air-conditioning wall controller. what is she doing? thought Oliver, when behind him a blue light came on and a door in the wall of the summer house opened an inch - a door he had never seen before.  How did mum do ..

Fingers appeared around the outside door he was pushing shut, fingers pushing the door open, allowing the figure in. 

Oliver shoved with all his might, slamming the fingers in the door jam.

"awwwwww, you little "

A huge shoulder slammed into the door flinging it open, knocking oliver backwards on to the floor.


Olivier gets shot
=================

Mr Cavalleo sneered an ugly sneer and shook his aching fingers and the sneer stayed on his face as he pointed the large pistol at the small
child's head from just a few feet away, and pulled the trigger.

Oliver had two thoughts go through his head.

The first is "He really is going to shoot me". Not like the "Get up there and
tidy your room or I will kill you" kind of threats he was used to.  But actual
kill you. In fact he had not even been threatened.  Cavalleo just walked into
his room, saw him and, and ... fired.

The second thought was "Oh god. I'm going to die".

Emotions don't always use the brain - they have to have extra help from
hormones in the body, telling the rest of the body what the brain has
worked out. So Oliver had not actually started to be upset as the
bullet left the gun, his hormones were still running hard to let the rest of his body know they should start screaming or running, or both.

Oliver's eyes saw the bullet leave the gun, heading straight for his
right eye.  The flame from the cartridge burst around the dark shadow
of the bullet, like pictures of a solar eclipse from a book, the Moon
getting larger and closer at deadly speed.  His hormones were really
running now, they knew that they had to let his stomach know to churn
up and get all upset.  And they knew that bullet was going to move
*fast*.

And then it wasn't.  

The Bullet had stopped - about six inches in
front of Oliver's right eye.  It stopped not because there was
anything wrong with the bullet - it stopped because it was now held by
a small clawed paw.  The ripples from the impact of the bullet hitting
the paw were starting to travel down the small creatures arm, fluffing out the
wet fur in circles down the arm towards the body.


The bullet itself had become odd and misshapen - the back part of the
bullet was still round and flat but it had been pushing the front half
- the front half had *tried* to keep on going but had found the paw was
not going to go anywhere - and so the front part of the bullet had
molded itself to the paw, trying to edge round between each individual
claw like steel silly putty.


The small furry animal was looking sideways back at Oliver.  It
reminded Oliver of the time his friend at school Benny, had caught a
tennis ball thrown really hard in a game of "duck or hurt" - instead
of the usual laugh and smile Benny had just turned and looked back at
Oliver and gave him this "That was awesome, but I'm just going smile a
tiny part of my mouth and be cool, because that is awesome-r"


Yeah that's how the Otter was looking at him.  Awesome-er


Then the otters eyes slid back to Mr Cavalleo.  Mr Cavalleo's own eyes
were trying to catch up with events.  After trying to simply kill a
small child with a shot to the head, Mr Cavalleo's eyes (and the rest
of him) was trying to get a better look at what seemed impossible -
the bullet had stopped, no, it had been *caught*.  By something that
looked like an ... Mr Cavalleo stuck his neck forward to get a better
look.  Turns out that was a bad idea.


Otters, it seems, don't like cold-hearted, vicious would-be child
killers.  

In fact, Otters really really don't like cold-hearted,
vicious would-be child killers.  

So the Otter head-butted him.  Hard.


Now an otter weighs only three or four pounds, even wet.  And Mr
Cavalleo would be described by his closest friends, if he had any, as - well “a right fat bastard”, and weighs at least 24 Stone.  

In normal circumstances (if you
can ever call getting an otter nutting you between the eyeballs normal circumstances) the otter would have pretty much no
effect.


It certainly would not throw Mr Cavalleo backwards fully six feet to
land spread-eagled against the wall, brick dust spreading down.

But this is what happened.

The otter landed lightly back down on Oliver's lap, and jumped down to
the floor, tossing the lump of metal that mere seconds ago was the
bullet going to end Oliver's life over his furry shoulder.


"Come on," said the otter to Oliver, "let's get you out of here. then we
can find your parents."


Oliver blinked once, quite slowly and then scrambled after the … umm … *talking* otter
now walking out the door while behind them the limp
body of Mr Cavalleo peeled itself off the wall and thumped down to the
floor.



Blurb
=====

Oliver thinks he is having a bad day.  His parents have been
kidnapped, and a
cold-blooded, evil killer is about to shoot him dead.

But Oliver also met an otter  today.

An Otter from Space.

Oliver's day is about to get a lot better.

And anyone not on the Otter's side is about to have a really, *really*
bad day.
