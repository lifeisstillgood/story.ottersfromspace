The otter led Oliver towards the river at the bottom of the garden, shielded by a line of trees from the kitchen and slid quickly into the river, then jumped back to the bank with a snall plastic loop in its paws. He beckoned to Oliver who knealt down to get his ear close to the otters mouth

"Lie on your stomach, let me put this on, then roll into the water." 

"what about my -"

"your mum is ok - they need her alive." 

The sound of a large copper bottomed frying pan hitting a human head drifted over the garden again.

Oliver laid down by the rivers edge and the otter snapped the loop around his neck like a cheap necklace. instantly a feeling like icecold jell-o creeping over his face, and Ollie tried to hokd his breath in surprise. 

"Just breathe normally - its a multi-phase molecular filter - it will filter oxygen out of the water for you.  We are going swimming".

"Roll into the water" the otter called as he ran in that undukating manner otters have. He ran into the trees and Ollie just started to roll over he heard another closer scream, and the river water closed over him.

Small paws touched his face and he heard the otters voice - an accent he could not place right now - "open your eyes mate, its gonna be fine." 

Ollie opened his eyes and saw, well a murky river, but he could see. He breathed in to calm himself down, then realised he was underwater and tried to stop breathing, then realised that his breath was fine, which surprised him
so much he stopped breathing and at this point his brain gave up and just grabbed onto the otter with both hands.

"Ok - cool.  Lets go"

The otter swung round and with Ollie holding on started to swim a little above the river bed, pulling Ollie with him.

Ollie just concentrated on sorting out his breathing for  a while - in, out, in, out, out again, no wait in. Oh god is that an otter. Ouch was that a weed? And another? How fast are we going? 

Chapter four
============

"How you doing back there?" 

Ollie did not answer. He thought about it but between concentrating on breathing, getting smacked in the face by  river weeds and holding onto to a speeding, talking (!) otter, his body felt it was dealing with enough without small talk.

"Hmm. I think we can take a short break. Maybe a chit-chat"

The water around Olivers wetsuit slowed and he felt himself slowly curving upwards, till he crested the surface, still holding onto th e otter and being pulled towards a lower portion of the bank.

Ollie vaguely recognised this part of the river, several miles downstream from his house.  He was pretty sure the Odeon cinema was in the local town.

The otter was on the bank now holding onto Olivers hand as the river current tried to carry him past.  Ollie pulled himaelf up and got about halfway, but his body did not really have the effort left - the past few minutes, yes only minutes had been - well been crazy. Ollie looked at the otter and the otter smilled and just pulled him bubthe hand.

Really Ollie was not heavy. Not as large as his dad. He was just normal sized for a teenager.  And yet an otter should not be able to pull him out of the ricer.  But it was simplicity itself

"Super easy. Barely an inconvenice"

Ollie laughed at the Yiutube quote as he was pulled up along the grassy bank.

The otter smiled and said "ah - thinking of something a bit normal now eh?"

"yeah - how did you know? Can you read my mind?"

"No, you just smiled for no reason. Usually means humans are remembering something. Hard to read minds and frankly never worth the effort.  Might as well just ask"

"oh" Said Oliver.

"Erm" Said Oliver.

"uhh." Said Oliver.  The otrer sat down next to Oliver whose legs were just dangling over the bank.  They both sat silently in the sunshine for a bit watching the rover pass under their feet / paws.

"what happened to my mum?"

"Well, she has been kidnapped by a secret society dedicated to the destruction of the human race"

"What?"

"Well they did hit her with a knock out gas, but she is pretty handy with a knock out frying pan.  Traditional methods are frequently the best.  And they tend to hire piss poor criminals.  Because beinf a secret society means your recruitment and training is just awful."

"what"

"I mean it. You try and hire the best people when your mission statement is "kill
all humans".  Its not something you can put on Monster.com.  And then even if you do find someone good you cannot tell them the whole plan, cos secret right. So you meed one controlling mind telling people what to do - loses all the improvisionation , all the creativity just goes out the window. So you lose the decision making cadence.

"what?!"
