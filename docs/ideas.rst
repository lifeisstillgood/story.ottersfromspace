"But why an Otter?" asked Oliver.

"Because Otters are cool."  shrugged the Otter, coolly.

"Err, why?"

The Otter turned slightly to get a better look at Oliver, his head
tipping so the right eye went slightly higher, and its eyebrow higher
still.  A small pair of very small, very stylish jet black sunglasses
materialised in the Otter's paw.  Materialised is not right - they
started to *grow* as if the glasses were being knitted into existence
from threads of the very night, the leading edge of the glasses jagged
and uneven but the edge wiping across, the parts of the glasses now in
the Otter's paw pulling the next part into existence from somewhere
else.  Without moving, the Otter raised the slowly-forming
glasses to his eyes, and just as the final atoms slotted into place,
slipped them on.  The Otter otherwise did not move.

"Because"

Said the Otter.

Coolly.

"Putting sunglasses on does not make you cool". Objected Oliver.

The Otter turned slowly and kept walking down the path towards the
hill.

"*Making* sunglasses from the molecules of the very air around us,
overcoming the Strong Nuclear Forces holding atoms together in order
to create plastic eyewear, *and* doing it while holding your gaze
... that's cool."

Oliver stared for a bit as the Otter kept on walking, no, strutting,
up the path.

"Yeah" said Oliver very quietly, "that is a bit cool".  And he rose
and started off up the path following the Otter.
