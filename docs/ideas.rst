"But why an Otter?" asked Oliver.

"Because Otters are cool."  shrugged the Otter, coolly.

"Err, why?"

The Otter turned slightly to get a better look at Oliver, his head
tipping so the right eye went slightly higher, and its eyebrow higher
still.  A small pair of very small, very stylish jet black sunglasses
materialised in the Otter's paw.  Materialised is not right - they
started to *grow* as if the glasses were being knitted into existence
from threads of the very night, the leading edge of the glasses jagged
and uneven but the edge wiping across, the parts of the glasses now in
the Otter's paw pulling the next part into existence from somewhere
else.  Without moving, the Otter raised the slowly-forming
glasses to his eyes, and just as the final atoms slotted into place,
slipped them on.  The Otter otherwise did not move.

"Because"

Said the Otter.

Coolly.

"Putting sunglasses on does not make you cool". Objected Oliver.

The Otter turned slowly and kept walking down the path towards the
hill.

"*Making* sunglasses from the molecules of the very air around us,
overcoming the Strong Nuclear Forces holding atoms together in order
to create plastic eyewear, *and* doing it while holding your gaze
... that's cool."

Oliver stared for a bit as the Otter kept on walking, no, strutting,
up the path.

"Yeah" said Oliver very quietly, "that is a bit cool".  And he rose
and started off up the path following the Otter.

---------------
A paired AI has been sent to destroy the human civilisation. This will mean that when the quantum entangled black hole currently travelling at 90% of the speed of light arrives at the Lagrange point between earth abs jupiter, then by Galaxtic Law, confirmed by a court case 800 years ago, then any solar system used as a jump point must share a (fairly large) percentage of it's toll traffic 

This new hole is going to reduce by a factor of four the humber of jumps needed to get from two of the largest trading spiral arms 

In short it's going to be a lot of cash. 

Well worth killing a few monkeys over. 



I live for ever - floating in space, the planet beneath you blown away
all those you loved gone


Otter is a student, around a thousand years old, (eleventy centuries) sent to study earth (was hoping for dinosaurs but waaay too late).  Been here since middle ages and loving the funnel monkeys

He is only just picking up modern trends - so "up to date for him is disco" - this should be the last chapter

OttoPosia - home planet 


Otter is 200 year old student from another spiral arm, sent to do research on dolphins. 


Halo jump - reference the red bull thing, mile high jump 30 mins, otter has to come in from outer space, catch and parachute. so can lean into physics of de-orbiting and catching.  This will be part of a process of moving an asteroid that's going to hit earth - have to investigate as it has been nudge already but keeps coming back on path 

Limitations on energy weapon use (paperwork is almost two days worth)


There is another transmission - an AI keeps rebuilding itself from an original transmission and trying to wipe out the planet - to allow for easy emplacement of wormhole due to arrive in 2122  - if humanity is alive and in space then they get 33.3% of gate revenues for two centuries, plus a seat on the spiral arm council.  Frankly genocide is cheaper as long as no one catches you.  

It's called a sneak and destroy 








Analogy - hell on wheels and comanche ?

Name of Otter: Rick - otter
Likes the taste of it.
