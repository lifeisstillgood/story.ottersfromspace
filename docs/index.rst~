=================
Otters From Space
=================

Billy thinks he is having a bad day.  His parents have been kidnapped,
a billion dollar secret formula has been stolen, and a cold-blooded,
evil killer has a gun pointed at his head.

All Billy has on his side is an Otter he befriended in the river
earlier in the day.

An Otter from Space.

Billy's day is about to get a lot better.  And a whole lot more exciting.

And anyone not on the Otter's side is about to have a really, *really* bad day.
