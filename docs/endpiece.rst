Otters are cool

Well, I guess 

Guess ! What do you mean guess. I do not need to guess.  I am a hyper-intelligent non-human lifeform, I have been on your planet for decades, studied your biosphere with instruments and analytical tools beyond your comprehension, I have processed your history and records, studied your seas and mountains in levels of detail that would make your greatest scientists quiver.  I have seen all of your world, it's history, it continents and oceans, every creature has been placed under my unforgiving microscope and I have come to one conclusion - Otters are the coolest creatures on your planet.

And ABBA is the coolest band your planet has ever produced.  So an otter singing "Dancing Queen" is absolutely the coolest thing there can possibly be.

So don't look like that.
